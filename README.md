# Open Library Volunteer Repository

Welcome! This is an unofficial repository for the Open Library. A repository made by volunteers, for volunteers! Here, volunteers can get the help they need from each other. The goal is to be as streamlined and open sourced as possible - a resource to keep everyone up to date with all the details in a free-flowing manner: a reference to help each other out, regardless of a person's presence!

Each person gets their own folder on this repository to add their Open Library-related community files in. The folder name is the person's first and last name. If you'd like to add to the Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m3Kp9W9p5jNbGaGJjvIsHyHYfv9yA-53?usp=sharing) instead, please message me for permission. If you'd like to label files based on project, use the format 'project name - first and last name' (of the person whose project it is - which would be the creator, not the team lead). Add project files, tips, archived discussions, etc. from the community about what they know, did, and can teach others to create an archive of the community's work.

Anyone who needs help with something that is not getting the help they need from the Open Library organization can come here to be helped! Feel free to post under the issues tab. Warning: because this is not the official Open Library, the resources are going to be much more limited.

Two reasons for its existence:
1) it's creation was to create a centralized location for files from the community for projects contributed to on the Open Library (otherwise everyone's files are private and inaccessible to each other)
2) To publish work on projects that are in progress with the Open Library that can be a benefit to the public before the projects are done.

About in-progress projects: The Open Library has difficulties working on UI/Design for their website. So the topic of most of the pre-project works will be on that: UI/web design.

To join in this repository: request an invitation.

Google Drive:
The series folder is to form the basis for creating a series layer on the OpenLibrary due to the need for it: 
Right now it's work and edition, but after work comes series. Later, after series would be 'universe', but that's a later step.

The data dump folder are how to do a mass results of searches on the OpenLibrary data dumps. 
Note: anyone can follow my instructions to do a mass search result!
Part 1 are for geting the rows and Part 2 is for the columns.
This helps out massively on mass-editing of the Open Library if desired. 
It's best to either create a bot to handle the errors or leave it alone. 
Manually mass-editing's not a good idea, because it's tedious and also might make it harder to find bot errors and correct them. 
Those errors are going to be there on purpose until fixed.
